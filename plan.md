**Step 1: Data Understanding and Preparation**

- Review Source Documentation: Go through any documentation or metadata provided with the datasets to understand the context and definitions of variables.

- Data Import: Load the provided datasets (`Cab_Data.csv`, `Customer_ID.csv`, `Transaction_ID.csv`, and `City.csv`) into our preferred data analysis environment (e.g., Python with pandas).

- Data Exploration: Perform initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to get a sense of the data. Use summary statistics, data visualizations, and basic queries to understand the structure and contents.

- Data Cleaning: Address data quality issues such as missing values, duplicates, and outliers. Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it's ready for analysis.

**Step 2: Hypothesis Generation**

- Brainstorm Hypotheses: Based on our initial data exploration, brainstorm 5-7 hypotheses related to the cab industry. For example, we can consider hypotheses about customer behavior, company performance, or market trends.

**Step 3: Data Analysis**

- Hypothesis Testing: For each hypothesis, design tests or analyses to investigate whether the data supports or refutes the hypothesis. Use appropriate statistical or data analysis techniques.

- Feature Engineering: Create new features or variables that might be relevant to our hypotheses. This could involve aggregations, transformations, or combinations of existing variables.

- External Data: As suggested, explore the possibility of incorporating third-party data (e.g., US holiday data, weather data) that could provide additional context or insights.

**Step 4: Presentation and Documentation**

- Create Visuals: Prepare visuals (charts, graphs, plots) that effectively communicate our findings and support our hypotheses. Make sure our visuals are clear and insightful.

- Analysis Documentation: Document the analysis process, including the steps we took, techniques used, and why certain approaches were chosen over others. This documentation will help in the presentation and in understanding our analysis later.

- Business Insights: Summarize our analysis findings and the insights gained from testing our hypotheses. Highlight key takeaways that XYZ (our hypothetical stakeholder can use to make informed investment decisions.

**Step 5: Presentation Preparation**

- Presentation Slides: Create slides for our presentation. Organize them logically, starting with an introduction, followed by hypothesis testing, key findings, and recommendations.

- Executive Summary: Provide a concise executive summary that captures the essence of our analysis and recommendations.

**Step 6: Presentation to XYZ’s Executive Team**

- Deliver Presentation: Present our findings, insights, and recommendations to XYZ’s Executive Team. Use the visuals and slides to communicate our analysis effectively.

**Step 7: Final Deliverables**

- Prepare the following deliverables for Week 2:

    1. EDA Notebook (an ipynb file) containing our code, data exploration, and hypothesis testing.

    2. Data Intake Report (a PDF file) summarizing the properties of the data, data cleaning steps, and any challenges encountered.

    3. EDA Recommendation and Hypothesis Results: Include this within our EDA Notebook. Document the results of our hypothesis testing and analysis.

**Step 8: Continuous Improvement**

- If time allows, consider further analyses or modeling to deepen our insights or predictions. We can also refine our analysis based on feedback from XYZ's Executive Team.

Remember, the goal is to provide actionable insights that will help XYZ make an informed investment decision in the cab industry. Be thorough in our analysis and communicate our findings clearly in the presentation.
