**Cab Data:**
1. **Date of Travel:** You can extract additional features such as the day of the week, month, or year from the date to investigate if there's any seasonality in cab usage.
2. **KM Travelled:** You might want to calculate the average distance traveled per ride.
3. **Price Charged:** You can calculate the profit margin by subtracting the "Cost of Trip" from the "Price Charged."

**Customer Data:**
1. **Age:** You can create age groups or bins to categorize customers by age range.
2. **Income (USD/Month):** Similar to age, you can create income groups or bins to categorize customers by income range.

**Transaction Data:**
1. **Payment_Mode:** You can convert this categorical variable into numerical values (e.g., 0 for Cash and 1 for Card) for analysis.

**City Data:**
1. **Population:** You might want to calculate the ratio of cab users to the city's population to understand cab usage per capita.
2. **Users:** This could be transformed into a numerical variable, potentially representing the number of users in each city.

These are some ideas for potential transformations and feature engineering. Depending on your specific analysis goals and hypotheses, you may choose to explore different transformations or create new features as needed. Please let me know which of these transformations you'd like to implement, and I can provide code examples accordingly.
