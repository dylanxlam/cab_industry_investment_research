Given that you've already cleaned the data, dealt with missing values, duplicates, and handled outliers, you're well on your way to finding actionable insights from your dataset. To further explore and extract meaningful insights, you can consider the following steps:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conduct in-depth EDA to understand the distribution and relationships among variables. Visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices can help identify patterns and trends.

2. **Feature Engineering:** Based on your initial transformations, you can create additional features that might be useful for analysis. For example, you've already created features like "Travel Day" and "Cab Users Per Capita." Think about other features that might provide valuable insights.

3. **Hypothesis Testing:** Formulate hypotheses about factors that could impact cab usage, such as day of the week, customer age groups, or income ranges. Use statistical tests to validate or reject these hypotheses.

4. **Segmentation:** Segment your dataset into groups based on relevant criteria, such as customer age groups, income ranges, or city populations. Analyze each segment separately to identify differences in cab usage patterns.

5. **Time Series Analysis:** Since you've extracted the day of the week, month, and year from the "Date of Travel," you can perform time series analysis to identify any seasonality or trends in cab usage over time.

6. **Profit Analysis:** Calculate and analyze profit margins for different companies or cities. Identify factors that contribute to higher profits, such as pricing strategies or cost control.

7. **Customer Behavior Analysis:** Explore how customer characteristics (age, income) and payment modes affect cab usage. Are there specific customer segments that use cabs more frequently or spend more?

8. **City Comparison:** Compare different cities in terms of cab usage per capita, population, and other relevant factors. Identify cities where the cab industry is thriving and potential growth opportunities.

9. **Machine Learning Models:** If you want to predict cab usage or customer behavior, consider building predictive models using regression, classification, or clustering techniques.

10. **Visualization:** Use data visualization tools to create insightful charts and graphs that can effectively communicate your findings to stakeholders.

To find the best actionable insights, it's essential to approach your analysis with a combination of statistical rigor, domain knowledge, and creative thinking. Feel free to ask specific questions or share more details about your analysis goals, and I can provide more targeted guidance.
